# mvrec

## Description

# version 2.2

# originally started with a new script file from scratch
# called depth, as I changed the approach to the problem
# by realising it's more efficient to rename directories
# and files starting at the greatest depth of the di-
# rectory tree and go backwards to the least at the top
# of it.
